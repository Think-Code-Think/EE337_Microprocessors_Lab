# Microprocessors Laboratory

Welcome to the Microprocessors Laboratory repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for the labs completed using assembly language and embedded C language on the Keil uVision5 software. Throughout the course, we explored various aspects of microcontroller programming and implementation using the Atmel (now Microchip) AT89C5131A microcontroller.

## Labs Overview

In this laboratory, we completed 10 comprehensive labs covering a wide range of topics and applications utilizing the AT89C5131A microcontroller. Each lab provided valuable insights into microcontroller programming and embedded systems. Here's a detailed overview of each lab:

1. **Lab 1**: Introduction to Keil and Basic Assembly Code
   - Learned how to use Keil uVision5 and wrote basic assembly code.

2. **Lab 2**: Assembly Programming - add16 and xor_swap
   - Implemented assembly programs for add16 and xor_swap operations.

3. **Lab 3**: Assembly Programming - Multiply and Accumulate (MAC), DELAY 5s Subroutine, PT-51 Test Program
   - Developed assembly programs for Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operation, DELAY 5s subroutine, and PT-51 Test Program.

4. **Lab 4**: Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
   - Wrote an assembly program to convert an analog signal to a digital signal.

5. **Lab 5**: LCD Interfacing and Binary Classification Assembly Program
   - Explored LCD interfacing and developed a basic Binary Classification assembly program.

6. **Lab 6**: Timers, Interrupts, and Speaker Interface
   - Used timers and interrupts in embedded C code and interfaced a speaker to play musical notes.

7. **Lab 7**: Pt-51 Musical Instrument Interface
   - Utilized the Pt-51 board as a musical instrument by interfacing it with a keypad and speaker.

8. **Lab 8**: Serial Port Interface (SPI) and Temperature Measurement
   - Implemented serial port interface (SPI) to interface an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) MCP3008 with the 8051 microcontroller. Also set up SPI to measure room temperature using the LM35 temperature sensor.

9. **Lab 9**: USB-to-UART Communication and Transaction System
   - Developed a program for communicating between Pt-51 and a computer using a USB-to-UART adapter (Prolific PL2303) and Realterm software. Created a basic transaction system.

## Project: Low-Pass Digital FIR Filter using Pt-51

In addition to the labs, a significant project was undertaken focusing on implementing a Low-Pass Digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter using the Pt-51 board. The project utilized USB-UART communication and integrated Python code to enhance functionality and control. This project provided hands-on experience in signal processing, hardware interfacing, and software integration.
