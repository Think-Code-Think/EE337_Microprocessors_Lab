# Microprocessors Laboratory

Welcome to the Microprocessors Laboratory repository! This repository contains the code and documentation for the labs completed using assembly language and embedded C language on the Keil uVision5 software. Throughout the course, we explored various aspects of microcontroller programming and implementation using the Atmel (now Microchip) AT89C5131A microcontroller.

## Labs Overview

In this laboratory, we delved into 10 comprehensive labs covering a wide range of topics and applications utilizing the AT89C5131A microcontroller. Each lab provided valuable insights into microcontroller programming and embedded systems. Here's a brief overview of the labs:

1. **Lab 1**: Introduction to AT89C5131A Microcontroller
2. **Lab 2**: GPIO Configuration and LED Blinking
3. **Lab 3**: Interrupts and Timers
4. **Lab 4**: Serial Communication (UART)
5. **Lab 5**: Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
6. **Lab 6**: Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC)
7. **Lab 7**: PWM Generation
8. **Lab 8**: LCD Interfacing
9. **Lab 9**: I2C Communication Protocol
10. **Lab 10**: SPI Communication Protocol

## Project: Low-Pass Digital FIR Filter using Pt-51

In addition to the labs, a significant project was undertaken focusing on implementing a Low-Pass Digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter using the Pt-51 board. The project utilized USB-UART communication and integrated Python code to enhance functionality and control. This project provided hands-on experience in signal processing, hardware interfacing, and software integration.

## Exam Question Papers and Solutions

You can also find the question papers and their solution codes for both the midsem and endsem exams uploaded in this repository. These resources serve as valuable study materials and aids in preparing for the examinations.
